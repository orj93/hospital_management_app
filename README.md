## Implementation of a infirmary management app.

In this project a database is created where every row is a patient in an infirmary. Each patient has attributes such as name, surname, disease, age, medical specialty, etc.
It also has one attribute called 'activo' which says if the patient is currently at the infirmary or it has been discharged.

With this app you can register new patients (adding them to the database) and visualize the status of active patients (those who are at the infirmary). 
You can also discharge them, or edit any of its attributes.

In the active patients screen you will find an 'altas' button that will take you to a new screen where you can visualize the discharged patients with new attributes like the discharge date and the how many days they have been at the infirmary
